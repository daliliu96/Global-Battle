综述:
=====
本游戏代码分为两部分编写.

第一部分是游戏引擎，包含显示，键盘控制等基本部分.

第二部分是Utilities(下称Uti),以函数为主，包含如图片路径，资料载入&读取，多媒体功能等

安装:
先将PATH.txt文件移动至C盘根目录下 ,然后用记事本编辑，将原有路径改为该电脑上放置Global Battle文件夹的位置

关于武器商店（Market):
协同开发者可以很简便的将自己设计的武器加入武器商店。

在武器系统中包含两个文件, 第一个是PNG格式的武器图片， 第二个是一个txt格式文本文件，用于储存武器信息。

两个文件的位置位于 '/res/market', 图片分辨率必须为1280x600. 信息文件的格式为: '名称',价格,破坏力,类型.

关于EXE版本:
现已推出经过编译的EXE文件，OIC Technology将会负责持续更新

推出EXE版本意味着更好的兼容性与更高的性能，电脑无需安装Python就可以运行。另外EXE版本在显示方面有更好的优化

自从第四发行版（MS2)以后的版本都将会伴随开发版一同于Google Code页面发布更新
